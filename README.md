# VibeBase: The House Party App

VibeBase is a Spotify-based house party app,  inspired by the ‘no-backend’ theory. Allows all the invitees to the party to vibe to the same music. 

Users can create a room, link their Spotify, and set rules i.e if they can pause the song and the number of votes required to skip the current song for the participants. The participants join the room with the unique code provided by the host. This helps everyone in the room listen to the music they all love.
